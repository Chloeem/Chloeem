Hello :)

I'm ChloÃ«, welcome to my profile.

I have just completed the (10% course acceptance rate) Makers Academy Bootcamp, gratefully chosen out of 200 potential candidates down to 6 as a scholar and ambassador student with Codebar.

Currently I am mentoring with Makers, along with learning Ruby on Rails and setting some good practices in place with the 'Foundations of Humane Technology' course at the Centre for Humane Technology. I am looking for a Junior Backend Engineer role within an agile company focused on driving change and positive impact. I work best in fast-paced environments with growth and learning as a continuous framework, and in a team that fosters a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. For me, code should bring people together, build communities, aid accessibility for all, break down borders, establish foundations and offer greater futures. I truly believe we are responsible for what we create or put out into the world - I want to be a part of the change for now and future generations. 

If the above aligns with your company or you'd just like to have a chat, I'd love to connect.

Thanks for reading!
