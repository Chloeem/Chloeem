Hello :)

I'm ChloÃ«, welcome to my profile.

I have just completed the (10% course acceptance rate) Makers Academy Bootcamp, gratefully chosen out of 200 potential candidates down to 6 as a scholar and ambassador student with Codebar.

Finding out I had ADHD a few years back caused me to reassess the challenges in my life, break down the stigma which shadows this diagnosis, and get properly in touch with how I learn and engage with the world around me. Coding has helped me to see the power held within my neurodivergent mind. It has connected the vital dots to helping me understand the superpowers contained inside me; deep empathy, hyperfocus, high adaptability, intrinsic problem-solving, analytical and divergent thinking, and innate creativity. 

I hope one day to be able to extend that experience out to others who are doubting themselves or feel becoming a developer is inaccessible. I hope one day to be able to extend this experience to those who feel becoming a developer is inaccessible. It is so important for us to have key role models we look to and witness paving aspirational footpaths. It would be incredible to be able to help set further in motion these wheels of representation. With this, building programs and algorithms that benefit a more dynamic view of society as a whole. 

Currently I am mentoring with Makers, along with learning Ruby on Rails and setting some good practices in place with the 'Foundations of Humane Technology' course at the Centre for Humane Technology.

I am looking for a Junior Backend Engineer role within an agile company focused on driving change and positive impact. I work best in fast-paced environments with growth and learning as a continuous framework, and in a team that fosters a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. For me, code should bring people together, build communities, aid accessibility for all, break down borders, establish foundations and offer greater futures. I truly believe we are responsible for what we create or put out into the world - I want to be a part of the change for now and future generations.

If the above aligns with your company or you'd just like to have a chat, I'd love to connect.

Thanks for reading!
