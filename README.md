Hello :)

I'm ChloÃ«, welcome to my profile.

I have just completed the (10% acceptance) Makers Academy Bootcamp in Software Engineering, gratefully chosen out of 200 potential candidates down to 6 as a scholar and ambassador student with Codebar. 

I am currently about to start mentoring with Codebar and Makers, along with learning Ruby on Rails and setting some good practices in place with the 'Foundations of Humane Technology' course at the Centre for Humane Technology.

Finding out I had ADHD a few years back caused me to reassess the challenges in my life, break down the stigma which shadows this diagnosis, and get properly in touch with how I learn and engage with the world around me. Coding has helped me to see the power held within my neurodivergent mind. It has connected dots that before felt lost in a haze, helping me to understand the superpowers contained within me; deep empathy, hyperfocus, high adaptability, intrinsic problem-solving, analytical and divergent thinking, and bounds of creativity. 

I hope one day to be able to extend that experience out to others who are doubting themselves or feel becoming a developer is inaccessible. It is so important for all of us to have key role models to look to who are paving an aspirational footpath and breaking stereotypes. It would be incredible to be able to help set further in motion these wheels of representation. With this, building programs and algorithms that benefit a more dynamic view of society as a whole. 

With this considered, I am looking for a graduate backend software development role within an agile company focused on driving change and positive impact. I work best in fast-paced environments with growth and learning as a continuous framework. That fosters a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion within the team. For me, code should bring people together, build communities, aid accessibility for all, break down borders, establish foundations and offer greater futures. I truly believe we are responsible for what we create or put out into the world. I want to be a part of the change for now and future generations.

If the above aligns with your company or you'd just like to have a chat, I'd love to connect.

Thanks for reading!
